\section{ESG Efficient Frontier Bachelor Thesis}

This repository contains the code and report for a bachelor thesis on the efficient frontier and ESG in portfolio optimization on.

The efficient frontier is a concept in finance that represents the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return 
for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. The efficient frontier is an important tool 
in portfolio optimization, as it helps investors to find the optimal portfolio that balances risk and return.

In this thesis, we explore the efficient frontier using modern portfolio theory and different optimization techniques.
We start by introducing the concept of the efficient frontier and explaining its importance in portfolio optimization.

To access the data and run the efficient frontier for ESG data implementation, please run the function get_filtered_stock_data() from the fil DATA.py and run in the MAIN.ipynb. 
The get_filtered_stock_data() function is used to filter the stock data based on different criteria. You can read most read what it exactly takes in the fil DATA.py.
The efficient_frontier.py module contains utility functions for portfolio optimization, including the construction of the efficient frontier using ESG data and can also be run in MAIN.ipynb
